# LGS-lib
This is a library for scriping in Logitech Gaming Software. Common actions needed for making a macro have been encapsulated and simplified, which makes this library easier to use compared with the official api.

## Usage
A template file (`template.lua`) is provided, which includes all the library functions and variables. You can just start with this file and add your macros in it. The file is well commented, so you won't get lost. After you become familiar with its structure, feel free to modify it according to your taste!

For more detailed information, please refer to the wiki pages.
